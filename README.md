# Arduino-based-Expected-Time-of-Arrival-system
Hi, I am exploring a basic to intermediate Expected Time of Arrival (ETA) system for mass public transport. The system shall be based on relevant Arduino microcontroller platforms. I have access to a real time GPS satellite tracking system for automobiles and would like to hack that to display the ETA on high resolution LED boards.
